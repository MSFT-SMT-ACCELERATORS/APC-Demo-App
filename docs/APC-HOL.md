## Introduction to Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC)

### Overview of APC

Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) is an Azure service that connects cloud applications to mobile operator networks APIs. It offers a streamlined method to access an array of operator network services, simplifying the use of telecommunications capabilities like SIM swap detection and location-based services through easy-to-implement APIs

![APC Diagram](./imgs/apc-diagram.jpg)

### Architecture

 Hereâ€™s a high-level view of the typical architecture:

- **Application Clients**: (Client App Innstance in diagram) These can range from Single Page Applications (SPAs) to mobile apps or any other client-side applications. They are the consumer-facing end of the system, interacting with the application service to perform various tasks like SIM swap checks or retrieving location data.

- **Application Service**: (Application Backend in diagram) This is the backend that your application clients communicate with. It is responsible for processing client requests, handling business logic, and making authenticated calls to the APC Gateway. This service can be hosted on cloud platforms like Azure or on-premises.

- **APC Gateway**: Hosted on Azure, the APC Gateway is an intermediary that securely connects to multiple operator networks. It translates the requests from the application service into the specific protocols, authentication and data formats that telecom operators require.

- **Operator Network APIs**: These are the services and APIs provided by telecom operators, which offer functionality such as number verification, SIM swap detection, and user location services. APC abstracts the complexities of these operator-specific APIs, presenting a unified and standardized interface for the application service to interact with.

Here is an overview diagram depicting the interaction between these components:

![APC Simple diagram](./imgs/hol-image-54.png)

### APC Planned Operator APIs

APC provides direct access to a range of operator APIs, designed to streamline complex telecom functionalities into developer-friendly services. Below is a table summarizing the currently supported and planned operator APIs:

This could be via a mobile hotspot connection from a mobile device or through a 4G/5G router equipped with a SIM card. [Read more about supported cellular connections for these exercises](#network-limitations).

#### Create APC Gateway Instance

Before you proceed with creating an APC Gateway instance, ensure you have completed all prerequisites outlined in the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites). This includes signing up for the APC Public Preview, which is necessary for the APC Gateway to be available in your Azure portal.

* Follow the [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/programmable-connectivity/azure-programmable-connectivity-create-gateway) to create a gateway, or have one already.
* Once you are done creating the gateway, note down the APC Gateway resoruce id endpoint, as explained in this section.

Deploying an APC Gateway in Azure is a straightforward process that involves the following steps:

1. **Open Azure Portal**: Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and log in with your credentials.

1. **Search for `APC Gateways`** and then select **Create**. If the APC Gateway does not appear as an available resource, please revisit the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites) and ensure you have successfully registered for the [APC public preview](https://aka.ms/APCpublicpreview).

   ![Search for APC Gateway](./imgs/001-01-set-up-portal-create.jpg)

2. Select your **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, and **Region**.

   ![Create APC Gateway](./imgs/001-02-set-up-portal-create-step1.jpg)

3. Provide a unique **Name** for your gateway and proceed to the next steps.

Once your gateway is created, you'll need to configure it:

1. Assign the telecom operator setup for the cellular network you'll be using and selecting the the Network API plans for:

    - Location
    - SIM Swap
    - Number Verification

    ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-47.png)

2. Complete the application details, which will be shared with the operator for validation.

   ![Configure APC](./imgs/001-02-set-up-portal-create-step2.jpg)

3. Agree to the operators' terms and conditions to finalize the setup.

Now, note down relevant resource information for later steps:

1. Navigate to your APC Gateway resource in the Azure portal and copy the `resource Id` and the `endpoint` value:

![APC Gateway resource](./imgs/hol-image-38.png)

#### Set up authentication

To authenticate and access the APC Gateway, create a Microsoft Entra application in the same directory or tenant.

1. Follow the instructions to [register an application with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal), create a service principal and record the clientId and secret.
    1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a **Cloud Application Administrator**. 
    1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** then select **New registration**.
    1. Name the application, for example "apc-hol-exercise". 
    1. Select a supported account type, which determines who can use the application. For the exercises in this lab it wonÂ´t matter since we are using a client credentials flow with Client Id and secret.
    1. DonÂ´t specify any return URI as itÂ´s not needed for these HOL exercises.
    1. Select **Register**.

    ![App Registration](./imgs/hol-image-40.png)

2. Create and record the application client ID and client secret or certificate for future use.
    1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**, then select your application.
    1. Select **Certificates & secrets**.
    1. Select **Client secrets**, and then Select **New client secret**.
    1. Provide a description of the secret, and a duration.
    1. Select **Add**.

        ![Record Client Secret](./imgs/hol-image-34.png)

3. Assign the necessary role to interact with the APC Gateway to your application by running the following Azure CLI command. Replace or assign values to `$SUB_ID` with your subscription id, `RG_NAME` with resource group name where the APC Gateway resource is and `$GATEWAY_NAME` for and the APC Gateway resource name. Log in using `az login` if you have to:

    ```sh
    az role assignment create --role 609c0c20-e0a0-4a71-b99f-e7e755ac493d
    --scope /subscriptions/$SUB_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME/providers/Microsoft.ProgrammableConnectivity/gateways/$GATEWAY_NAME
    --assignee $APP_ID
    ```

### Use Network APIs with the APC SDK Client

The APC SDK simplifies making API calls by providing strongly typed methods for each APC service. Here's how to get started:

#### Create a Console Application

To start using the Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) SDK, you'll need to create a new console application. This application will serve as the foundation for integrating with APC services.

1. Open your IDE or code editor.
2. Create a new .NET 8 console application project.
3. Name your project appropriately to reflect its purpose, such as `APCIntegration`.

#### Install the APC SDK

With your project created, the next step is to install the APC SDK:

1. Use the NuGet Package Manager to find a prerelease NuGet by checking `Include prerelease` checkbox and search for `Azure.Communication.ProgrammableConnectivity`. Install the latest version of the SDK to your project.

    ![APC SDK nugget install](./imgs/hol-image-57.png)
    
2. or use dotnet CLI to install the NuGet Package from the project folder path:

    ```sh
    dotnet add package Azure.Communication.ProgrammableConnectivity --prerelease
    ```

#### Instanciate an authenticated client

The client library uses [`Azure.Identity`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity?view=azure-dotnet) credentials to authenticate with APC. 

1. Install Azure.Identity nugget package with the Nuget Package Manager or with the following command. (Uncheck `Include prerelease` checkbox):

    ```sh
    dotnet add package Azure.Identity
    ```

    ![Azure.Identity nugget install](./imgs/hol-image-41.png)

2. In Program.cs, create values for the recorded APC Gateway information and Entra client credentials from earlier steps.

    ```csharp
    // Setup your APC endpoint and gateway resource id here
    var apcEndpoint = "https://eastus.prod.apcgatewayapi.azure.com";
    var apcGatewayId = "/subscriptions/$your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/$your-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.programmableconnectivity/gateways/$your-gateway-name";

    // Your Azure Entra application's details
    var clientId = "your-application-client-id";
    var clientSecret = "your-application-client-secret";
    var tenantId = "your-tenant-id";
    ```

3. Obtain client credential by implementing this authentication logic in your application using the noted clientId and clientSecret from the authentication section in prerequisites.

    ```csharp
    // Instantiate the auth client credential
    TokenCredential credential = new ClientSecretCredential(tenantId, clientId, clientSecret);
    ```

3. Instanciate the SDK client using:

    ```csharp
    // Instantiate the APC client
    ProgrammableConnectivityClient apcClient = new ProgrammableConnectivityClient(new(apcEndpoint), credential));
    ```
![Console app APC SDK setup with auth](./imgs/hol-image-58.png)


#### Make APC SDK requests

For each call that you make to APC with the SDK, you will follow the same pattern:
* Create a client `apcClient = new ProgrammableConnectivityClient()`
* Access the sub-client for your use case (sim-swap/location/number-verification/device-network) by calling say `apcClient.GetSimSwapClient()`
* Create the content for your request by using the objects given by the SDK, for example `SimSwapVerificationContent`
* Call the client with the content you've created
* Access the result

**Reminder:** As noted in the prerequisites, make sure that your device is connected to a cellular network (via a mobile hotspot or a 4G/5G router with a SIM card) while performing these requests. This is crucial for successfully testing and validating features that require real network interactions, such as device network retrieval or number verification.

##### APC SDK: Retrieve Network Information

To make APC operator API calls, you'll need the network identifier for the cellular network device address you are calling from. More informtion on this APC Call: [Device Network](#device-network).


1. Access the subclient for the device network from the base client created earlier `apcClient`:

    ```csharp
    // Retrieve network information
    var deviceNetworkApcClient = apcClient.GetDeviceNetworkClient();
    ```

2. **Retrieve the Local IP Address:** Add code to dynamically retrieve the IP address of the network interface that is up and running and not a loopback interface.

    ```csharp
    // Retrieve the local IP address dynamically
    var host = Dns.GetHostEntry(Dns.GetHostName());
    var localIP = host.AddressList.FirstOrDefault(ip => ip.AddressFamily == System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily.InterNetwork);
    ```


2. Create the device-network request content using the SDK class `Networkidentifier`. Use the previously obtained public ip. APC will identify which operator network is managing it:

    ```csharp
    var networkIdentifier = new NetworkIdentifier("IPv4", localIP.ToString());
    ```

3. Retrieve the device-network response:

    ```csharp
    Response<NetworkRetrievalResult> networkResponse = deviceNetworkApcClient.Retrieve(apcGatewayId, networkIdentifier);
    Console.WriteLine($"Network Identifier result: {networkResponse.Value}");
    ```

![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-59.png)


##### APC SDK: Sim Swap retrieve/verify

Once you have the client configured and retrieved the network identifier, proceed to make a Sim Swap verification request. This call will check whether the SIM card you are using for the cellular network has been replaced recently.For more informtion on this APC Call: [Sim Swap Detection](#sim-swap-detection). 

1. Create the sim-swap request content using the SDK class `SimSwapVerificationContent`. PhoneNumber `phone-number` with your actual number associated with the cellular network you are using. Include the country code. You should have the cellular network identifier in the previous request:

    ```csharp
    // Retrieve SIM swap verification
    SimSwapVerificationContent simSwapContent = new SimSwapVerificationContent(new NetworkIdentifier("NetworkCode", networkResponse.Value.NetworkCode))
    {
        PhoneNumber = "+00number-with-countrycode",
        MaxAgeHours = 240
    };
    ```

2. Add code to access the subclient for sim-swap from the base client created earlier `apcClient`:

    ```csharp
    var simSwapApcClient = apcClient.GetSimSwapClient();
    ```

3. Retrieve the device-network response:

    ```csharp
    Response<SimSwapVerificationResult> response = client.Verify(ApcGatewayId, content);
    Console.WriteLine($"Verification result: {response.Value.VerificationResult}");
    ```

(OPTIONAL) If you wish to test more APC APIs using this method, find in the annex additional APC API calls with implementation details using the APC .NET SDK approach:

- [APC SDK: Device Location](#apc-sdk-device-location)
- [APC SDK: Number Verification ](#apc-sdk-number-verification)

### Use Network APIs with APC REST APIs

This section covers how to interact with Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) using REST HTTP calls. You'll learn to set up Postman for making authenticated requests, and how to construct these requests using .NET HttpClient in a console application.

#### A. Make APC requests with Postman

To make authenticated requests to APC using REST HTTP calls, follow the process aided by the postman collection referenced in this guide.

- Make sure the collection has the authentication token properly configured. If this is not done prior to making a request or the token has expired (1 hour lifetime) the requests will return **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** results.
- Navigate to the desired APC request, for instance `sim-swap:verify`
- Create the content for your request by replacing the payload examples given in postman with your information
- Send the request
- Access the result

**Reminder:** As noted in the prerequisites, make sure that your device is connected to a cellular network (via a mobile hotspot or a 4G/5G router with a SIM card) while performing these requests. This is crucial for successfully testing and validating features that require real network interactions, such as device network retrieval or number verification.

##### Setup: Configure Postman for Authenticated Requests to APC

To make authenticated requests to the APC API, you need to set up Postman with the correct authorization headers. Here are the steps to configure Postman:

1. Open Postman, click import and drag the collection linked in this repo [Link to APC Postman collection](Azure%20Programmable%20Connectivity%20(APC)%20HOL.postman_collection.json)

    ![Import collection](./imgs/hol-image-6.png)

2. Double click the collection name that appeared on the collection side menu and go to the tab `Variables`. From there, update the `auth-secret`, `auth-clientId`, `auth-tenantid` and also the `apc-id` and `endpont` values. 

    ![Collection auth var](./imgs/hol-image-30.png)
    ![Collection APC Gateway id var](./imgs/hol-image-33.png)

3. Click save or press `Ctrl+S` and go to the tab `Authorization`

    ![Collection auth tab](./imgs/hol-image-7.png)

4. Scroll down to `Configure New Token` advanced section and click the button `Generate New Access Token`

    ![Collection Get new token](./imgs/hol-image-32.png)

5. Once succeeded, select `Use Token`. This token will be valid for 1 hour. You can skip to the Generate New Token step every time it expires.

    ![Collection use token](./imgs/hol-image-31.png)


##### Postman APC SimSwap Verify Request

To make APC operator API calls, you'll need the network identifier for the cellular network device address you are calling from. More informtion on this APC Call: [Device Netwrok](#device-network).

1. Navigate to `network:retrive` request

  ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-42.png)

2. **Obtain Your Public IP Address**: Before adjusting the request payload, you need to obtain the public IP address of your cellular connection. You can do this by:
   
   - **Using Postman Echo Service**: Postman provides a free service that echoes the requests made to it. Send a request to `https://postman-echo.com/ip`, and it will return your public IP address. You can then copy this IP address into your APC request.
   
   - **Alternative Method**:
     If you prefer using an online tool, visit a website such as `https://www.whatismyip.com` from your device connected via the cellular network to find out your public IP address.

3. **Adjust the Request Payload in the `Body` Tab**
   With your public IP address in hand, adjust the payload under the `Body` tab of your request. Replace the `identifier` value with the IP address you obtained.

   **Body**:
   ```json
   {
       "identifierType": "IPv4",
       "identifier": "<your-public-IP-using-cellular-network>"
   }
    ```

    ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-43.png)

3. Click `Send` and view the response

    ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-11.png)

##### Postman APC SimSwap Verify Request

1. Navigate to `sim-swap:verify` request

    ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-44.png)

2. Adjust the request payload in the `Body` tab

    - For the `networkIdentifier.identifier` property should contain the result from the network retrieve request you made earlier.
    - `phoneNumber` property should contain the phone number including country code **you are using for cellular network connectiviy**.

More information on properties for this Network API: [Sim Swap Detection](#sim-swap-detection)

Here's an example for the request payload to perform a SIM Swap verify:

**Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
    "networkIdentifier": {
      "identifierType": "NetworkCode",
      "identifier": "network-code-here"
    }
  }
  ```
  ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-10.png)

3. Click `Send` and view the response

  ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-11.png)

#### B. Make APC requests with .NET HttpClient

You can also use the .NET HttpClient to make authenticated calls to APC. Here's a basic example of how you can implement this in a .NET 8 console application:

##### Set up a .NET httpClient for APC
1. Create a Console App project in Net8.0 in your preferred IDE.
2. In Program.cs, create values for the recorded APC Gateway information and Entra client credentials from earlier steps.

    ```csharp
    // Setup your APC endpoint and gateway resource id here
    var apcEndpoint = "https://eastus.prod.apcgatewayapi.azure.com";
    var apcGatewayId = "/subscriptions/$your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/$your-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.programmableconnectivity/gateways/$your-gateway-name";

    // Your Azure Entra application's details
    var clientId = "your-application-client-id";
    var clientSecret = "your-application-client-secret";
    var tenantId = "your-tenant-id";
    ```

3. Install Azure.Identity nugget package with the Nuget Package Manager or with the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet add package Azure.Identity
    ```

    ![Azure.Identity nugget install](./imgs/hol-image-41.png)

4. Add the following code to Retrieve a token for your HttpClient.:
    ```csharp
    // Authentication with Azure AD to obtain Bearer Token.
    var credential = new ClientSecretCredential(tenantId, clientId, clientSecret);
    var token = await credential.GetTokenAsync(new Azure.Core.TokenRequestContext(new[] { "https://management.azure.com/.default" }));
    string accessToken = token.Token;
    ```

5. Add the required headers to call APC using a REST client:
    ```csharp
    // Prepare the HttpClient with the Bearer token and common headers.
    using var httpClient = new HttpClient();
    httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseUrl);
    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("apc-gateway-id", apcGatewayId);
    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
    ```

Now you are ready to start calling APC API:

![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-18.png)

##### Http APC Call #1: Retrieve Network Information
To make APC operator API calls, you'll need the network identifier for the cellular network device address you are calling from. More informtion on this APC Call: [Device Netwrok](#device-network).


2. **Retrieve the Local IP Address:** Add code to dynamically retrieve the IP address of the network interface that is up and running and not a loopback interface.

    ```csharp
    // Retrieve the local IP address dynamically
    var host = Dns.GetHostEntry(Dns.GetHostName());
    var localIP = host.AddressList.FirstOrDefault(ip => ip.AddressFamily == System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily.InterNetwork);
    ```

1. Prepare the network retrieve request content. Use the previously obtained public ip. APC will identify which operator network is managing it:

    ```csharp
    string networkApiUrl = $"{baseUrl}/device-network/network:retrieve";
    var networkIdentifier = new
    {
        identifierType = "IPv4",
        identifier = localIP.ToString()
    };
    var networkContent = new StringContent(JsonSerializer.Serialize(networkIdentifier), Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
    ```

2. Create `NetworkRetrievalResult` class: This class will hold the result from the network retrieval call. You can place it at the end of Program.cs for simplicity.

    ```csharp
    public class NetworkRetrievalResult
    {
        public string NetworkCode { get; set; }
    }
    ```

3. Retrieve the device-network response:

    ```csharp
    HttpResponseMessage networkResponse = await httpClient.PostAsync(networkApiUrl, networkContent);
    var networkResult = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync<NetworkRetrievalResult>(await networkResponse.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(), new JsonSerializerOptions{PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true});
    Console.WriteLine($"Network retrieval result: {networkResult}");
    ```
    ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-49.png)

##### Http APC Call #2: Verify Sim Swap

Once you have the HTTP client configured and retrieved the network identifier, proceed to make a Sim Swap verification request. This call will check whether the SIM card you are using for the cellular network has been replaced recently. For more informtion on this APC Call: [Sim Swap Detection](#sim-swap-detection). 

1. Prepare the verify sim swap content:

    ```csharp
    string simSwapApiUrl = $"{baseUrl}/sim-swap/sim-swap:verify";
    var simSwapContent = new
    {
        phoneNumber = "your-phone-with-country-code",
        maxAgeHours = 240,
        networkCode = networkResult.networkCode
    };
    var simSwapRequestContent = new StringContent(JsonSerializer.Serialize(simSwapContent), Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
    ```

2. Create `SimSwapVerificationResult` class: This class will hold the result from the sim swap verification call. You can place it at the end of Program.cs for simplicity.

    ```csharp
    public class SimSwapVerificationResult
    {
        public bool VerificationResult  { get; set; }
    }
    ```

3. Retrieve the verify sim swap response:
    ```csharp
    HttpResponseMessage simSwapResponse = await httpClient.PostAsync(simSwapApiUrl, simSwapRequestContent);
    var simSwapResult = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync<SimSwapVerificationResult>(await simSwapResponse.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(),
        new JsonSerializerOptions { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true });
    Console.WriteLine($"Sim swap verification result: {simSwapResult.VerificationResult}");
    ```

### Hands-On: Application code highlighs
This section will guide you through the key parts of the application code, explaining the flow of APC requests, network limitations, and the process of APC number verification.

#### Make APC Requests from an app: APC Request Flow

The APC request flow is a critical component of the application. Understanding this flow will help you grasp how the application interacts with the APC Gateway securely. Hereâ€™s an example of how this is implemented:

This diagram shows the request flow from the app to the backend and then to the APC Gateway:

![APC Simple diagram](./imgs/hol-image-54.png)

Direct APC calls from the frontend are not advisable due to the sensitive nature of the credentials involved (client ID and secret). Exposing these details can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of Azure resources, as browser tools allow easy access to frontend code. Instead, APC calls are delegated to the backend service, the APC Proxy, which securely handles authentication and integration.


1. **The client app makes a request with the required Network API payload to the backend service.** [Link to js service](../../APC.MobileApp//ReactNative/app/Services/APCService.ts):

    ```ts
    // apcClient is an autogenerated axios client that points to the backend service
    export const checkSimChange = async (apiClient: APCApi, phoneNumber: string) => {
        const networkCode = await getNetworkCode(apiClient);
        const response = await apiClient.apiAPCSimSwapSimSwapverifyPost({
            phoneNumber:  '+' + phoneNumber,
            maxAgeHours: 240,
            networkIdentifier: {
                identifierType: 'NetworkCode',
                identifier: networkCode
            }
        })

        return response.data.verificationResult;
    }
    ```

2. **The backend service processes the call and makes an authenticated request to the APC Gateway using the SDK or a custom REST HTTP client** [Optional: (More on the multiple implementations)](../leaves-implementation-details.md#dependency-injection-for-apc-sdk-http-client-and-mockservice).

Example using the APC SDK [Link to SDK client](../../APC.Proxy.API/APC.Client/APCSdkClient.cs):

    ```csharp
    public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> SimSwapRetrieveAsync(DataModel.SimSwapRetrievalContent request)
    {
        var content = new SimSwapRetrievalContent(new(request.NetworkIdentifier.IdentifierType, request.NetworkIdentifier.Identifier));

        var simSwapClient = _apcClient.GetSimSwapClient();
        var response = await simSwapClient.RetrieveAsync(_apcGatewayId, content);
        return await CreateHttpResponseMessageAsync(response);
    }
    ```

Example using the REST Http client instead [Link to REST Http Client](../../APC.Proxy.API/APC.Client/APCClientDI.cs):

    ```csharp
    // Configure httpClient with APC API settings
    _httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(settings.Value.BaseUri);
    _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("apc-gateway-id", _settings.GatewayId);

    ...

    public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> CallApcApiAsync(HttpMethod httpMethod, string endpoint, object? requestContent = null)
    {
        var accessToken = await GetAccessTokenAsync();
        var request = new HttpRequestMessage(httpMethod, endpoint)
        {
            Content = requestContent != null ? JsonContent.Create(requestContent) : null
        };

        request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
        request.Headers.Add("x-ms-client-request-id", Guid.NewGuid().ToString());

        var response = await _httpClient.SendAsync(request);

        return response;
    }
    ```

3. **The APC Gateway respone is returned to the client application**

#### Network Limitations
Using applications with Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) requires understanding some network connectivity nuances. To use the Network APIs with APC, you need identification from the device making the request. Operators assign external IPs to the cellular network-connected device, as well as a phone number. To identify a device, it's possible to use the currently assigned IPv4/IPv6 address (using the cellular network) or the SIM phone number.

This application is intended to run on phones using cellular networks (4G, 5G) from the users' SIM cards from supported telecom operators. The app uses Network APIs to perform anti-fraud verifications based on this network information. APC requests include device identification information to map and authenticate the request against the right operator.

For this reason, there are some considerations within the app implementation:

- **The app must use the cellular connection:** In a normal use case, the phone should avoid using the WiFi connection. This is why when opening the app it will display a warning message if your wifi connection is active when opening the applicatiom.
  - In this demo app, the client application checks for WiFi connectivity using the Expo API. On some other implementations, apps should use cellular connectivity for these APC requests instead of WiFi.

- **The backend must retrieve the caller IPs:** This ensures that no one is impersonating the user.
  - In this demo app, the APC Proxy backend gathers network info using the IP from frontend requests and uses this IP as the identifier for further APC requests. This ensures that the requests to the APC Gateway are authenticated and authorized based on the originating network's IP.
  
      ```csharp
      [ApiController]
      [Route("[controller]")]
      public class NetworkInfoController : ControllerBase
      {
          [HttpGet]
          public IActionResult GetNetworkInfo()
          {
              // Retrieve the remote IP address and port from the HttpContext
              var remoteIpAddress = Request.HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress?.ToString();
              var remotePort = Request.HttpContext.Connection.RemotePort;

              // Check if the IP address is not available
              if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(remoteIpAddress))
              {
                  return NotFound("Remote IP address not found.");
              }

              // Return the remote IP address and port
              return Ok($"Remote IP address: {remoteIpAddress}, Remote port: {remotePort}");
          }
      }
      ```

- Some network API calls need to happen using the actual device network: For example, number verification requires the use of the device's actual network.

##### Initial steps
1. **Disable WiFi access for your device**
- **Open the application:** Use the QR as described in the [Leaves Bank app documentation](../leaves-deployment.md).
- If your wifi connection is active when opening the applicatiom, it will display a warning message. Using WiFi is still permited since it could be that the device is connected to netwok hotspot from a phone or 4G/5G router sharing its cellular connection, which is valid for these HOL exercises.

2. **Click Get Started:** During the first steps, the application will make a **device-network request** to the backend, where the backend captures the caller IP.

    ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-52.png)

Additionally, operations like number verification follow a specific process that requires these requests to come from the same network as the phone number being checked. Making requests from IP addresses outside the intended network will result in unathorized results in APC hence **the client application must use the cellular network instead of an available WiFI** connection from a non cellular network.

#### Number Verification Process Overview

1. Input the phone number for the cellular network you are using.
    - This could be either phone number for the sim card used in your device or if you are connecting to a hotspot network for this exercise, the phone number for the hotspot device. More information in [network limitations](#network-limitations).

    ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-51.png)

2. Press the checkmark icon to verify the phone number

    ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-53.png)

One of the main challenges in implementing number verification is that it requires part of the user flow to be performed from the client app, not just the backend. This is necessary because [Number Verification Network API request](#number-verification) follows an OAuth authentication flow, which involves multiple steps and interactions between the client app, the backend, the APC service and the Operator auth servers.

Here's an overview of the number verification process:

1. User Initiates Verification: The user initiates the number verification process **from the client app to the number verification endpoint in the backend**.

2. Redirect to APC: The **backend service makes a request to the APC Gateway**, including a redirect URI in the body to a callback endpoint in the backend.

3. Redirect to OAuth Authorization Server: **APC redirects the request to the operator authorization server** with the appropriate client ID and redirect URI for authorization.

4. Authorization Server Response: The OAuth authorization server processes the request and **returns to the client app a 302 redirect response towards the backend service** with an authorization code.

5. Exchange Authorization Code: **the backend service makes a request to the APC Gateway with the auth code** and APC exchanges the received authorization code with the operator auth services and if succeeded the verification response.

6. Return Verification Result: APC returns the verification result to the **backend service**, which then communicates the **result back to the client**.

The diagram below illustrates the detailed flow of the number verification process:

![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-62.png)

##### Initial Request from Client App to Backend Service:
1. **Client App (Leaves Bank App)** sends a request to initiate number verification using standard HTTP request libraries like Axios. This phase is crucial as it sets the foundation for the authentication process that follows. Note that this request doesn't require special handling; it is a typical HTTP request initiated by the client.
2. **Leaves Bank Backend Service** prepares to request an authentication code from the APC gateway.

##### Backend Service Requests APC Gateway:
After receiving the initial request, the Leaves Bank Backend Service prepares to interact with the APC gateway. 

3. **APC Gateway Call**: The backend makes a POST request to APC Gateway, the response will have Status HTTP 302 but the redirections must be followed by the frontend, as these requests must come from the cellular network the client app is using.

4. **302 Redirect Response**: APC responds with a 302 redirect containing a URL for client app interaction.

##### Manually handling redirections in the backend:
To ensure proper handling of the HTTP 302 responses from the APC gateway, configure the backend's HTTP client to prevent automatic redirection. The frontend has to handle the actual redirections for the authentication flow against the Operator Authentication Services.

To implement this, you can use the .NET HTTP client in the backend to configure the handling of HTTP redirect responses manually. Here's how you can modify the .NET HTTP client to prevent automatic redirection:

5. **Prevent Automatic Redirection in .NET 8 HttpClient**:

    ```csharp
    var handler = new HttpClientHandler { AllowAutoRedirect = false };
    using var httpClient = new HttpClient(handler);
    ```

The client app can follow redirections automatically until it retrieves a response.

##### Backend Service endpoints for Number Verification

The number verification process utilizes two key backend endpoints, as seen in the APCController in the leaves bank backend service [Link to file](../APC.Proxy.API/APC.ProxyServer/Controllers/APCController.cs):

1. **Initial Verification Endpoint**:
   - This endpoint receives the initial request from the frontend, issuing an HTTP 302 response with a location URL.
   - The frontend follows the redirection path outlined earlier, eventually receiving an authentication code from the operator's authentication service.

    ```csharp
    // Endpoint to initiate number verification
    [HttpPost("number-verification/number:verify")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> NumberVerificationVerify([FromBody] NumberVerificationWithoutCodeContent request)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation($"Request model: {JsonSerializer.Serialize(request)}");

        return await HandleRequest(
            () => _apcClient.NumberVerificationVerifyAsync(request),
            "Error occurred while verifying phone number.");
    }
    ```

2. **Callback Endpoint**:
   - This endpoint handles the reception of the authentication code sent back by the frontend.
   - The frontend client will call this endpoint when following the last HTTP 302 redirection. As this endpoint uri was provided in the initial number verification call in the `returnUrl` value/

    ```csharp
    // Callback endpoint to finalize verification
    [HttpGet("number-verification/apcauthcallback")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> NumberVerificationRetrieve(string apcCode)
    {
        return await HandleRequest(
            () => _apcClient.NumberVerificationCallbackVerifyAsync(new NumberVerificationWithCodeContent() { ApcCode = apcCode }),
            "Error occurred while retrieving phone number.");
    }
    ```


#### Handling Consent Permission for Location Verification

For Network API operations that require device location information, such as location verification, it's essential to manage consent permissions effectively. This section outlines how the banking app ensures compliance with privacy regulations and operator terms during such processes.

1. **User Redirects for Consent**: If the operator requires user consent for location verification, the banking app redirects users to a consent page. This step is crucial for maintaining compliance with privacy regulations and respecting user and operator terms.

2. **Handling Location Access Errors**: Proper error handling is vital when operators deny location access. While the demo app does not handle this scenario explicitly, it's recommended to implement the following approach:
   - The backend service should capture any errors related to location access denials.
   - These errors typically include a URL provided by the operator that contains instructions for the user to grant location verification permissions.
   - The frontend should then open a browser window directing the user to this URL, allowing them to follow their operator's instructions to grant necessary permissions.

### Additional APC SDK examples using .NET SDK

##### APC SDK: Device Location

Device location verification can fail if the operator line owner has not given location verification permission for this application. More on this and how to approach it in code [here](#handling-consent-permission-for-locaction-verification)

1. Add code to access the subclient for sim-swap from the base client created earlier `apcClient`:
```csharp
var deviceLocationClient = apcClient.GetDeviceLocationClient();
```
2. Create the location-verify request content using the SDK class `DeviceLocationVerificationContent`. PhoneNumber `phone-number` with your actual number associated with the cellular network you are using:
```csharp
var deviceLocationVerificationContent = new DeviceLocationVerificationContent(new NetworkIdentifier("NetworkCode", "Telefonica_Brazil"), 80.0, 85.1, 50, new LocationDevice
{
    PhoneNumber = "+8000000000000",
});
```
3. Retrieve the device-network response:
```csharp
Response<DeviceLocationVerificationResult> result = deviceLocationClient.Verify(apcGatewayId, deviceLocationVerificationContent);
Console.WriteLine(result.Value.VerificationResult);
```
![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-15.png)

##### APC SDK: Number verification

Number verification involves 2 steps. In the first request, you receive a redirect URL that must be followed, in order to get teh ApcCode. Then in the second request, the ApcCode gets sent in.

For the fist call:

1. Add code to access the subclient for sim-swap from the base client created earlier `apcClient`:
```csharp
NumberVerification numberVerificationClient = apcClient.GetNumberVerificationClient();

```
2. Create the number verification request content using the SDK class `NumberVerificationWithoutCodeContent`. PhoneNumber `phone-number` with your actual number associated with the cellular network you are using:
```csharp
NumberVerificationWithoutCodeContent numberVerificationWithoutCodeContent = new NumberVerificationWithoutCodeContent(
    new NetworkIdentifier("NetworkCode", "Telefonica_Spain"),
    new Uri("http://your-redirect-url.com")){ PhoneNumber = "<phoneNumber>", };

```
3. Retrieve the apcCode from the response:
```csharp
var response = await numberVerificationClient.VerifyWithoutCodeAsync(apcGatewayId, numberVerificationWithoutCodeContent);

var locationUrl = response.GetRawResponse().Headers.TryGetValue("location", out var location) ? location : "not found";

Console.WriteLine($"location redirect URL: {locationUrl}");
```

For the second call

1. Retrieve the code by following the previous `locationUrl`:
```csharp
var apcCode = "aad"; // WIP follow locationUrl
```
2. Create the number verification request content using the SDK class `NumberVerificationWithCodeContent`. Use the `apcCode` retrieved:
```csharp
NumberVerificationWithCodeContent numberVerificationWithCodeContent = new NumberVerificationWithCodeContent(apcCode);
```
3. Retrieve the verification result with the code `NumberVerificationWithCodeContent`. Use the `apcCode` retrieved:
```csharp
Response<NumberVerificationResult> numberVerificationResponse = await numberVerificationClient.VerifyWithCodeAsync(apcGatewayId, numberVerificationWithCodeContent);
Console.WriteLine(numberVerificationResponse.Value.VerificationResult);
```

### Additional APC REST HTTP examples using .NET HttpClient

##### HttpClient APC: Verify device location
1. Prepare the device location verify content:
```csharp
string locationApiUrl = $"{baseUrl}/device-location/location:verify";
var locationContent = new
{
    networkIdentifier = new { networkCode = networkResult.networkCode },
    latitude = 40.7128,
    longitude = -74.0060,
    accuracy = 10,
    locationDevice = new { phoneNumber = "your-phone-with-country-code" }
};
var locationRequestContent = new StringContent(JsonSerializer.Serialize(locationContent), Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
```

2. Retrieve the device location verify response:
```csharp
HttpResponseMessage locationResponse = await httpClient.PostAsync(locationApiUrl, locationRequestContent);
var locationResult = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync<DeviceLocationVerificationResult>(await locationResponse.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(),
    new JsonSerializerOptions { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true });
Console.WriteLine($"Device location verification result: {locationResult.VerificationResult}");
```

##### HttpClient APC: Number verification


Number verification involves 2 APC requests along with some HTTP 302 redirections that in a normal scenario would befollowed automatically, refer to [Part 2: TODO LINk](#part-2-advanced-use-case---integrating-apc-into-a-banking-app) for real-word number verification example. 

**APC Requests for number verification:**

- Retrieve APC auth code flow: you receive some HTTP 302 redirect responses from and to operator authentication servers that should be followed to retrieve the APC Code.
- Verify the retrieved APC auth code.


1. Since the first call returns HTTP 302 redirect responses, set up the HttpClient you instanciated earlier to not automatically follow redirects.
    1. Create a `HttpClientHandler` with `AllowAutoRedirect` property set to false

        ```csharp
        var handler = new HttpClientHandler
        {
            AllowAutoRedirect = false
        };
        ```
    2. Add the handler as a parameter in the httpCleint constructor call.

        ```csharp
        using var httpClient = new HttpClient(handler);
        ```

2. Now that you disabled automatic redirection, make the first APC request and follow redirections  manually, as this is a demo exercise and not the intended setup.
    1. Prepare the number verification apc code retrieval request. The request content property `redirectUri` can be any Uri as it won't be followed in this case, however in real-word scenarios, this should a service of yours capable of making or propagating APC requests. ead more about real-word scenarios in [Part 2: TODO LINk](#part-2-advanced-use-case---integrating-apc-into-a-banking-app)
        ```csharp
        // Number verification
        // First Number Verification Request
        string numberVerificationInitUrl = $"{baseUrl}/number-verification/number:verify";
        var numberVerificationInitContent = new
        {
            networkIdentifier = new { identifierType = "NetworkCode", identifier = networkResult.networkCode },
            phoneNumber = "+34618125036",
            redirectUri = "https://localhost:7127/api/APC/number-verification/apcauthcallback"
        };
        var initRequestContent = new StringContent(JsonSerializer.Serialize(numberVerificationInitContent), Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
        ```
        ![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-36.png)

    2. **First APC Request:** Make the HTTP Request. The result should be a HTTP `302` response with a Location header containing the next call in the number verification flow. This location won't be followed automatically since we configured the HttpClient when instanciating it.
    
        ```csharp
        // Send the initial request and handle redirects to capture apcCode
        HttpResponseMessage initialNumberVerificationResponse = await httpClient.PostAsync(numberVerificationInitUrl, initRequestContent);
        ```

    3. Make a new HTTP GET to the url value from the `Location` header on the previous response. Send the GET request and copy the next `Location` header value from the new 302 response.
        ```csharp
        // Following redirects manually
        string firstRedirectUri = initialNumberVerificationResponse.Headers.Location?.ToString();
        HttpResponseMessage firstRedirectResponse = await httpClient.GetAsync(firstRedirectUri);
        ```
        ![Initial request with first redirection](./imgs/hol-image-37.png)

    4. Add the three remaining manual redirects.
        ```csharp
        // Following redirects manually
        string firstRedirectUri = initialNumberVerificationResponse.Headers.Location?.ToString();
        HttpResponseMessage firstRedirectResponse = await httpClient.GetAsync(firstRedirectUri);
        ```
        
    5. Recod the `Location` header value for the fourth redirect. It should contain the `redirectUri` you specified plus an `redirectUri` parameter.

For the second call

1. Retrieve the code by following the previous `locationUrl`:
```csharp
var apcCode = "aad"; // WIP follow locationUrl
```
2. Create the number verification request content using the SDK class `NumberVerificationWithCodeContent`. Use the `apcCode` retrieved:
```csharp
NumberVerificationWithCodeContent numberVerificationWithCodeContent = new NumberVerificationWithCodeContent(apcCode);
```
3. Retrieve the verification result with the code `NumberVerificationWithCodeContent`. Use the `apcCode` retrieved:
```csharp
Response<NumberVerificationResult> numberVerificationResponse = await numberVerificationClient.VerifyWithCodeAsync(apcGatewayId, numberVerificationWithCodeContent);
Console.WriteLine(numberVerificationResponse.Value.VerificationResult);
```

### Additional APC REST HTTP examples using Postman

##### Postman APC Number Verification Request

1. Navigate to `number-verification > number:verify` request
2. Adjust the request payload in the `Body` tab with your data.
  ```json
  {
    "networkIdentifier": {
      "identifierType": "NetworkCode",
      "identifier": "your-network-code"
    },
    "phoneNumber": "your-phone-inc-countrycode",
    "redirectUri": "your-service-auth-callback"
  }
  ```
![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-22.png)

3. Go to the settings tab and make sure the setting `Automatically follow redirects` is set to OFF. Following this step, you will procceed to manually follow **three** 302 redirect calls. In a normal scenario these would befollowed automatically, refer to [Part 2: TODO LINk](#part-2-advanced-use-case---integrating-apc-into-a-banking-app) for real-word number verification example. 

![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-23.png)

4. Click Send and once it completes the result should be a HTTP `302` response with a Location header containing the next call in the number verification flow. Copy the url value for the `Location` header. 

![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-24.png)

5. **1/3 302 request**: Create a new request in a new tab and paste the url value from the step before. Make sure the `Automatically follow redirects` setting is OFF. Send the GET request and copy the next `Location` header value from the new 302 response.

![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-26.png)

5. **2/3 302 request**: Create a new request in a new tab and paste the url value from the step before. Make sure the `Automatically follow redirects` setting is OFF. Send the GET request and copy the next `Location` header value from the new 302 response.

![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-27.png)

5. **3/3 302 request**: Create a new request in a new tab and paste the url value from the step before. Make sure the `Automatically follow redirects` setting is OFF. Send the GET request and copy the query param named `apcCode` in the `Location` header value from the new 302 response.

![alt text](./imgs/hol-image-28.png)

6. Go back to and modify the original `number-verification > number:verify` request's payload with the following content, then click Send to retrieve the number verification result.

```json
{
    "apcCode": "your-apc-code-retrieved-in-step-5"
}
```
