Part 1 of this lab is designed to give you a swift yet comprehensive introduction to APC, equipping you with the knowledge to deploy an APC Gateway and make initial API calls. It's ideal for learners who are new to APC or require a quick start guide for incorporating APC into their applications.

Part 2 is designed for a deeper dive into APC's real-world applications. It's ideal for those looking to understand the intricacies of integrating APC within a backend system and leveraging its full potential in complex projects. This section is recommended for anyone interested in the technical implementation of APC.
