## Get Started

This section provides a step-by-step guide to get the project up and running on your local machine and mobile device.

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Git
- Node.js
- .NET 8 SDK
- Azure CLI (for deployment)
- An active Azure subscription

## APC Gateway deployment and configuration

#### Create APC Gateway Instance

* Follow the [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/programmable-connectivity/azure-programmable-connectivity-create-gateway) to create a gateway, or have one already.
* Once you are done creating the gateway, note down the APC Gateway resoruce id endpoint, as explained in this section.

Deploying an APC Gateway in Azure is a straightforward process that involves the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, search for **APC Gateways** and then select **Create**.

   ![Search for APC Gateway](hol/imgs/001-01-set-up-portal-create.jpg)

2. Select your **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, and **Region**.

   ![Create APC Gateway](hol/imgs/001-02-set-up-portal-create-step1.jpg)

3. Provide a unique **Name** for your gateway and proceed to the next steps.

Once your gateway is created, you'll need to configure it:

1. Assign the telecom operator setup, selecting the SimSwap, Location and Number Verification APIs and plans.

2. Complete the application details, which will be shared with the operator for validation.

   ![Configure APC](hol/imgs/001-02-set-up-portal-create-step2.jpg)

3. Agree to the operators' terms and conditions to finalize the setup.

Now, note down relevant resource information for later steps:

1. Navigate to your APC Gateway resource in the Azure portal and copy the `resource Id` and the `endpoint` value:

#### Set up authentication

To authenticate and access the APC Gateway, create a Microsoft Entra application in the same directory or tenant.

1. Follow the instructions to [register an application with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal), create a service principal and record the clientId and secret.
    1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a **Cloud Application Administrator**. 
    1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** then select **New registration**.
    1. Name the application, for example "apc-hol-exercise". 
    1. Select a supported account type, which determines who can use the application. For the exercises in this lab it wonÂ´t matter since we are using a client credentials flow with Client Id and secret.
    1. Select **Register**.

    ![App Registration](image-40.png)

2. Create and record the application client ID and client secret or certificate for future use.
    1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**, then select your application.
    1. Select **Certificates & secrets**.
    1. Select **Client secrets**, and then Select **New client secret**.
    1. Provide a description of the secret, and a duration.
    1. Select **Add**.

![Record Client Secret](image-34.png)

3. Assign the necessary role to interact with the APC Gateway to your application by running the following Azure CLI command. Replace or assign values to `$SUB_ID` with your subscription id, `RG_NAME` with resource group name where the APC Gateway resource is and `$GATEWAY_NAME` for and the APC Gateway resource name. Log in using `az login` if you have to:

```sh
az role assignment create --role 609c0c20-e0a0-4a71-b99f-e7e755ac493d
--scope /subscriptions/$SUB_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME/providers/Microsoft.ProgrammableConnectivity/gateways/$GATEWAY_NAME
--assignee $APP_ID
```


## Backend configuration and deployment

### Build and configure the backend service locally

For local testing and development, you will need to update up the `appsettings.Development.json` file with the necessary configurations:

```json
{
   "APCClientSettings": {
   "AuthAppCredentials": {
      "ClientId": "your-client-id",
      "TenantId": "your-tenant-id",
      "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret"
   },
   "GatewayId": "your-gateway-id",
   "BaseUri": "https://your-apc-endpoint"
   }
}
```

#### Run the backend locally

1. **Navigate to the Backend Service Directory**
   ```
   cd [Repo path]/APC.Proxy.API
   ```

2. **Build the Project**
   ```
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the Backend Service**
   ```
   dotnet run --project APC.ProxyServer
   ```

4. **Open the swagger UI url int the browser for testing**. Make sure the port is correct and the uri is HTTP, not HTTPS.

   - `APCClientSettings__AuthAppCredentials__ClientId`
   - `APCClientSettings__AuthAppCredentials__TenantId`
   - `APCClientSettings__AuthAppCredentials__ClientSecret`
   - `APCClientSettings__GatewayId`
   - `APCClientSettings__BaseUri`

![alt text](image-11.png)

3. **Set CORS**: In the portal, navigate to "CORS" under the API section. Add `*` to allow all domains or specify your domain to restrict the cross-origin requests to your front end. **Save** the configurations to apply them,

![alt text](image-10.png)


#### Step 3: Deploy the Backend Code Using Azure CLI

Use an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vscode?view=aspnetcore-8.0#publish-to-azure), [Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-aspnet-web-app?view=vs-2022&tabs=azure) or similar to deploy to the newly created web app or follow these steps to do it with Azure CLI:

1. **Navigate to your project directory** and publish your .NET application:
   ```
   dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
   ```

2. **Download the publish profile** from your App Service Overview in the Azure Portal under "Download publish profile".

3. **Deploy using the Azure CLI**:
   ```
   az webapp deploy --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-app-name> --src-path ./publish --type zip --async true
   ```

4. Once done, **Open the swagger UI url int the browser for testing**
   ```
      https://localhost:7127/swagger/index.html
   ```
