# Support

This is a learning and examples repository with no official suport from Microsoft as you can get it for Microsoft products. However, as best as possible, the owner of this repository (Microsoft SMT) will try to track bugs and asks for the examples, demo app and Hands-On-Lab documentation. 

## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and requests. Please search the existing 
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or 
feature request as a new Issue.
