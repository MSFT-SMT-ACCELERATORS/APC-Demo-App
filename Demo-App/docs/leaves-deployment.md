## APC Gateway deployment and configuration

#### Create APC Gateway Instance

Before you proceed with creating an APC Gateway instance, ensure you have completed all prerequisites outlined in the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites). This includes signing up for the APC Public Preview, which is necessary for the APC Gateway to be available in your Azure portal.

* Follow the official [APC guide - How to create a Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/programmable-connectivity/azure-programmable-connectivity-create-gateway) to create a gateway, or have one already.
* Once you are done creating the gateway, note down the APC Gateway resoruce id endpoint, as explained in this section.

Deploying an APC Gateway in Azure is a straightforward process that involves the following steps:

1. **Open Azure Portal**: Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and log in with your credentials.

1. **Search for `APC Gateways`** and then select **Create**. If the APC Gateway does not appear as an available resource, please revisit the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites) and ensure you have successfully registered for the [APC public preview](https://aka.ms/APCpublicpreview).

2. Select your **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, and **Region**.

   ![Create APC Gateway](./imgs/leaves-image-19.png)

3. Provide a unique **Name** for your gateway and proceed to the next steps.

Once your gateway is created, you'll need to configure it:

1. Assign the telecom operator setup, selecting the SimSwap, Location and Number Verification APIs and plans.

2. Complete the application details, which will be shared with the operator for validation.

   ![Configure APC](./imgs/leaves-image-20.png)

3. Agree to the operators' terms and conditions to finalize the setup.

Now, note down relevant resource information for later steps:

1. Navigate to your APC Gateway resource in the Azure portal and copy the `resource Id` and the `endpoint` value:

   ![APC Gateway resource](./imgs/leaves-image-21.png)

#### Set up authentication

To authenticate and access the APC Gateway, create a Microsoft Entra application in the same directory or tenant.

1. Follow the instructions to [register an application with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal), create a service principal and record the clientId and secret.
    1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a **Cloud Application Administrator**. 
    1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** then select **New registration**.
    1. Name the application, for example "apc-hol-exercise". 
    1. Select a supported account type, which determines who can use the application. For the exercises in this lab it wonÂ´t matter since we are using a client credentials flow with Client Id and secret.
    1. Select **Register**.

    ![App Registration](./imgs/leaves-image-22.png)

2. Create and record the application client ID and client secret or certificate for future use.
    1. Browse to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations**, then select your application.
    1. Select **Certificates & secrets**.
    1. Select **Client secrets**, and then Select **New client secret**.
    1. Provide a description of the secret, and a duration.
    1. Select **Add**.

   ![Record Client Secret](./imgs/leaves-image-23.png)

3. Assign the necessary role to interact with the APC Gateway to your application by running the following Azure CLI command. Replace or assign values to `$SUB_ID` with your subscription id, `$RG_NAME` with resource group name where the APC Gateway resource is and `$GATEWAY_NAME` for and the APC Gateway resource name. Replace `$APP_ID` with the client Id from the authentication step. Log in using `az login` if you have to:

   ```sh
   az role assignment create --role 609c0c20-e0a0-4a71-b99f-e7e755ac493d
   --scope /subscriptions/$SUB_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME/providers/Microsoft.ProgrammableConnectivity/gateways/$GATEWAY_NAME
   --assignee $APP_ID
   ```

2. **Go to "Configuration"** under the Settings section and **Click on "New application setting"** to add each of the following settings. You'll need to add the relevant values for `ClientId`, `TenantId`, `ClientSecret`, `GatewayId`, and `BaseUri`:

   - `APCClientSettings__AuthAppCredentials__ClientId`
   - `APCClientSettings__AuthAppCredentials__TenantId`
   - `APCClientSettings__AuthAppCredentials__ClientSecret`
   - `APCClientSettings__GatewayId`
   - `APCClientSettings__BaseUri`

   ![alt text](./imgs/leaves-image-11.png)

3. **Set CORS**: In the portal, navigate to "CORS" under the API section. Add `*` to allow all domains or specify your domain to restrict the cross-origin requests to your front end. **Save** the configurations to apply them,

   ![alt text](./imgs/leaves-image-10.png)


#### Step 3: Deploy the Backend Code Using Azure CLI

Use an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vscode?view=aspnetcore-8.0#publish-to-azure), [Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-aspnet-web-app?view=vs-2022&tabs=azure) or similar to deploy to the newly created web app or follow these steps to do it with Azure CLI:

1. **Login and set Azure Subscription.** Replace `<subscription-name-or-id>` with your actual subscription name or ID.

   ```bash
   az login
   az account set --subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"
   ```

2. **Publish the Application.** Navigate to the directory containing the `APC.ProxyServer` project and publish it using the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet publish ./APC.ProxyServer/APC.ProxyServer.csproj -c Release -o ./publish
   ```

This command compiles the application in the Release configuration and outputs the files to the `./publish` directory.

3. **Package the published files into a ZIP file for deployment.** Run this command in the directory where the `publish` folder is located:

   ```powershell
   Compress-Archive -Path "./publish/*" -DestinationPath "./publish.zip"
   ```

4. **Deploy to Azure WebApp**
Use the Azure CLI to upload and deploy the ZIP file to your Azure WebApp. Replace `rg-HOL-lab` with your resource group name and `apc-hol-leavesbank-service` with your WebApp name.

   ```bash
   az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group rg-HOL-lab --name apc-hol-leavesbank-service --src "./publish.zip"
   ```

5. Once done, **Open the swagger UI url in the browser for verification**
   ```
   https://YOUR-WEB-APP-UI.azurewebsite.net/swagger/index.html
   ```
