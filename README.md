# Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) Repository

Welcome to the Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) Demo App  repository! This repository contains valuable resources to help you understand and implement APC in your applications. It is divided into two main sections:

## 1. Hands-On Lab (HOL)

The Hands-On Lab provides a step-by-step guide to get you started with APC, from setting up your environment to using APC's powerful network APIs for SIM swap detection, location services, phone number verification, and more.

- **Location**: `/docs/HOL/README.md`
- **Contents**: Introduction to APC, setting up, using APC SDK, direct HTTP calls to APC, advanced implementation details, and deploying/testing a demo banking application.

To dive into the Hands-On Lab, [click here](./docs/HOL/README.md).

## 2. APC Demo Application

The APC Demo Application showcases a real-life use case of integrating APC into a banking application. This section provides insights into direct SDK usage, handling APC with HTTP client, integration into frontend and backend services, and detailed implementation of APC features like SIM swap and number verification.

- **Readme location**: Guide for setting up and understanding the demo application can now be found at `/docs/APC-Demo-App/README.md`.
- **Source code**: find the client app and API modules in `/APC.MobileApp` and `/APC.Proxy.API`, respectively.
